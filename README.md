# 🖼️ Generating Realistic Images using GANs

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on **generating photo-realistic images** using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. The aim is to synthesize high-resolution images from noise or text-based embeddings for applications in creative industries, advertising, and synthetic data generation.

- **Problem**: Insufficient data leads to low model accuracy in real-world scenarios.
- **Solution**: Generate synthetic, realistic images to enhance datasets or create visual assets.
